This Form, I put in place some basics of the Document Object Model in JavaScript, implimenting a validation form with differents entry data type/category.
I put some restrictions on some data entry, for instance the "email" category, every time there will be an entry as an email, the data Formating should always be 
as required format. No Data entry shall remain unfilled. And after getting everything right, the submit button should redirect the user toward a new web page  thank 
the user.
